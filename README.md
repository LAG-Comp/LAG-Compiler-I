LAG-Compiler-I
==============

Final project for Compilers @UFRJ/2014.2

Compilation
-----------

To do the compilation you need to install the bison++ with:

```sudo apt-get install bison++```

After that you can compile this with:

```make```

The last command will compile the program and execute a test program.

Running
-------

To execute this compiler only type the follow:

```./trabalho < text_to_compile.lag```

Maybe you won't have a permission to run the above command,
so you will need give permission of execution to the file ```trabalho```
with the follow command you will can do that:

```chmod +x trabalho```
